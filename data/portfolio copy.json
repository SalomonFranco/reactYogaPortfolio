    "aboutpara": "Hi! My name is Pamela, and I am a certified yoga teacher and sound healer. My journey with yoga began in 2016, initially as a hobby to maintain my health and alleviate the physical and mental tensions stemming from my immune system disease, lupus. What started as a means to cope has transformed into a profound exploration of movement and self-discovery. Yoga has opened up new dimensions for me, enriching my life with a deeper understanding of both the body and mind. One of my greatest passions is free movement, particularly through dance. This love for movement harmonizes beautifully with my practice of Ashtanga yoga, which embodies dynamic flow and discipline, and Yin yoga, which emphasizes stillness, introspection and our connection with Nature. Through these two contrasting yet complementary styles, I have found a balance that nourishes my spirit and enhances my physical well-being. In my sessions, I also use sound healing, employing specific frequencies to create immersive experiences that foster relaxation and connection. Practicing and teaching yoga has been a life-changing experience that has become my lifestyle. I am deeply passionate about sharing my journey and knowledge with others, continuously immersing myself in learning and growth. My goal is to inspire students and colleagues within the yoga community by bringing forth a blend of discipline and positive energy, encouraging them to embrace their own paths to balance and freedom through movement.",
